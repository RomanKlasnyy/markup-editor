# Markup editor
This simple program is for people who are too lazy to write .md files!
It has **bold**, *italic*, [link](https://github.com) and even `inline code`!
This simple tool has special commands:
* Type `!help` for a list with commands and formatters
* Type `!done` to save your result into the .md file

I made this README.md with this tool. Isn't it cool? :D

## Supported languages:
- Go (1.22.0)
- Java SE 21 (LTS)
